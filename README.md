# Brain_Tumor_Detection

Note : this repo only consists of the back end code 

This project does dense layer classification which involves supervised training of the model so using a large dataset is a must !!

Now as we all know CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or what it is  
..if not then it is advised to get a basic grasp of CNN and its three layers as in this project we have used CNN for tumor/cancer detection

In the Code.py file there are comments to help you out with what the specific fuction is performing .

What this model Provided : Validation Accuracy = ranging from 84% - 92%  
if you are getting more(accuracy) it is recommended to increase the size of the dataset and number of epochs.
