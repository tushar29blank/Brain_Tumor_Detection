# Brain_Tumor_Detection

Note : this repo only consists of the back end code 

This project does dense layer classification which involves supervised training of the model so using a large dataset is a must !!

Now as we all might know CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or what it is i guess 
..if not then it is advised to get a basic grasp of CNN and its three layers as in this project we have used CNN for the tumor or cancer detection

In the Code.py file there are comments to help you out with what the specific fuction is performing (briefly)

What this model Provided : Validation Accuracy = ranging from 80% - 90%  
if you are getting more i would request you to increase the dataset or number of epochs.
