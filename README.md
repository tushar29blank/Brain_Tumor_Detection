# Brain Tumor Detection

**Note:** This repository contains only the backend code.

This project implements dense layer classification through supervised training, requiring a large dataset for optimal performance. The model leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for tumor detection. Familiarity with CNN and its three layers is recommended.

The `Code.py` file includes comments to guide you through the functionality of specific functions.

**Model Performance:**  
Validation Accuracy: 84% - 92%  
For higher accuracy, consider increasing the dataset size and the number of training epochs.
